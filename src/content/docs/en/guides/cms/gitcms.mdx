[GitCMS](https://gitcms.blog) is a Chrome extension that transforms GitHub into a powerful headless CMS, providing a Notion-like editing experience for managing static sites built with frameworks like Astro, Next.js, Hugo, Jekyll, and more. It allows developers and clients to manage content directly within GitHub's interface without the need for additional servers or complex setups.

## Prerequisites
- An existing Astro project with a GitHub repository.
- [GitCMS Chrome Extension](https://gitcms.blog) installed.

## Initializing GitCMS Configuration
1. **Install the GitCMS Chrome Extension**: Add the [GitCMS extension](https://gitcms.blog) to your Chrome browser.
2. **Initialize GitCMS in Your Repository**:
   - Navigate to your GitHub repository.
   - Click on the GitCMS icon in the Chrome extension menu.
   - Click the "Initialize" button in the popup.
   - This action will redirect you to a new file creation page on GitHub with `gitcms.md` as the filename, displaying the GitCMS configuration editor.

## Configuring Basic Information
1. **Website URL**: Enter your static site's URL (e.g., `https://yourblog.com`).
2. **Media Folder**: Specify the folder where your media files will be stored. This folder is typically managed by your static site generator.

## Adding Collections
Collections represent groups of related content, such as blog posts, pages, or team members.

1. **Add a Collection**:
   - Click the "Add Collection" button.
   - Provide a collection name (e.g., `posts`, `pages`, `authors`).
   - Specify the folder path where markdown files for this collection will be stored (e.g., `src/content/posts`).

2. **Configure Frontmatter Schema**:
   Define the structure and types of metadata for your content using various field types:
   - **Title Field**: For post titles and main headings.
   - **Single Line Field**: For short text like descriptions or tags.
   - **Multi Line Field**: For longer text content.
   - **DateTime**: For scheduling and publishing dates.
   - **MultiSelect**: For categories, tags, or any grouped attributes.
   - **File Input**: For media uploads, automatically managed in your media folder.
   - **Boolean Field**: For toggle options like draft status.

   Example configuration:
   ```yaml
   ---
   media_path: /public
   repo: YourUsername/your-repo
   website_url: https://yourwebsite.com
   
   collections:
     - name: posts
       file_extension: .md
       filename_pattern: title
       git_path: /src/content/posts
       metadata_schema:
         - name: title
           required: true
           type: title

         - name: description
           required: false
           type: multiline

         - name: date
           required: true
           type: datetime

         - name: image
           required: false
           type: file

         - allowed_values:
             - Product Updates
             - Features
             - Comparison

           name: categories
           required: true
           type: multi_select
         - allowed_values:
             - AuthorName

           name: authors
           required: true
           type: multi_select

         - name: draft
           required: false
           type: boolean

   ---
   ```

   This configuration is autogenerated by GitCMS through its UI, eliminating the need for manual editing.

## Creating Content with GitCMS

1. **Access the GitCMS Editor**:
   - Navigate to any markdown file in your configured collections within your GitHub repository.
   - Click the GitCMS extension icon to toggle between the GitHub and GitCMS editor.

2. **Utilize the Rich Editing Features**:
   - Visual markdown editing.
   - Structured metadata forms based on your frontmatter schema.
   - Media file uploads with real-time previews.

## Rendering GitCMS Content in Astro

Use Astro's Content Collections API to query and display your content.

**Displaying a Collection List**:

```tsx
---
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';
const posts = await getCollection('posts');
---
<ul>
  {posts.map(post => (
    <li>
      <a href={`/posts/{post.slug}`}>{post.data.title}</a>
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

**Displaying a Single Entry**:

```tsx
---
import { getEntry } from 'astro:content';

const post = await getEntry('posts', 'my-first-post');
const { Content } = await post.render();
---
<main>
  <h1>{post.data.title}</h1>
  <Content />
</main>
```

For more information on querying, filtering, and displaying your collections content, refer to Astro's [Content Collections documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/).
