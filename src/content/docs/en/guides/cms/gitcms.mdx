[GitCMS](https://gitcms.blog) is a Chrome extension that bridges the gap in static site generation (SSG) workflows by enhancing the writing and management experience for markdown files. It transforms GitHub into a powerful headless CMS, providing a Notion-like editing experience directly within GitHub's interface. With GitCMS, developers, clients, and content writers can write, manage, and search markdown content effortlessly â€” eliminating the pain of editing raw markdown or juggling file management. This makes managing content for Astro sites smoother, without additional servers or complex CMS setups.
